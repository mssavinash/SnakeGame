# SnakeGame
A Snake Game uses a grid, movement logic, collision detection, food generation, and a game loop in python language.

# How to Play
- Run the code in a Python environment.
- Use W (up), A (left), S (down), D (right) to control the snake.
- Eat the food (*) to grow longer.
- Avoid walls and self-collisions.

# Key Features
    Grid Representation:
        - @ represents the snake's head.
        - O represents the snake's body.
        - * represents food.
    Movement:
        - The snake moves continuously in the current direction.
        - Keyboard input changes direction (prevents 180-degree turns).
    Collision Detection:
        - Wall collisions (out-of-bounds).
        - Self-collisions (snake hitting itself).
    Food Mechanics:
        - Eating food increases snake length.
        - New food spawns in random empty spaces.
